Perfect 👍 — let’s make you a professional, visually appealing README for your Recipe Finder Application (Savora).

Before I generate it, please confirm a few quick details so I can tailor it exactly:

✅ Project name — is it Savora (as discussed before)?

⚙️ Tech stack — React + Tailwind + Vite + API integration?

🍳 API — are you using a real recipe API (like Spoonacular / Edamam) or a placeholder (like https://api.example.com)?

🧠 Project purpose/summary — should I describe it as a modern web app to discover, view, and save recipes from around the world?

👨‍💻 Your name/credit — include Developed by Emmanuel Akabike at the bottom?

🌐 Deployment — do you want me to include deployment instructions (e.g., Netlify / Vercel) or just local setup?

Once you confirm, I’ll generate a stylish README with sections like:

Overview

Features

Tech Stack

Environment Setup

Folder Structure

Screenshots (placeholder links)

Contributing

License

Would you like the tone to be professional and clean or fun and modern (with emojis and color badges)?
